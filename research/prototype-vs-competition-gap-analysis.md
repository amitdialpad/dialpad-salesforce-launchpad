## Detailed Gap Analysis

### 1. CHARTS & VISUALIZATIONS (Critical Gap)

**What We Have:**
- Gray placeholder boxes with text "Chart: [Description] (Placeholder)"

**What Competitors Have:**
- Aircall: Bar charts, line graphs, pie charts for all metrics
- Talkdesk: Real-time updating charts with drill-down
- Five9: Progress bars, gauge charts, trend lines
- NICE: Advanced analytics visualizations with AI insights

**Impact:** HIGH - Charts are essential for quick data interpretation. Current placeholders make prototype look incomplete.

**Recommendation:**
- **Phase 1:** Add simple Chart.js or D3.js charts with mock data
- **Phase 2:** Use Salesforce native chart components
- Charts needed:
  - Calls by Department (bar chart)
  - Calls over Time (line chart)
  - Call Distribution (pie/donut chart)
  - Agent Performance Comparison (bar chart)
  - Missed Calls by Hour (line chart)

---

### 2. FUNCTIONAL FILTERS (Critical Gap)

**What We Have:**
- Filter UI elements (date pickers, dropdowns)
- Non-functional - clicking does nothing

**What Competitors Have:**
- Fully functional filters that update data in real-time
- Filter by: date range, user, department, office, status, call type
- Multiple filters can be combined
- "Apply" or auto-apply functionality
- Clear/reset filters option

**Impact:** HIGH - Users expect filters to work. Non-functional filters create frustration.

**Recommendation:**
- Make filters functional in prototype using JavaScript
- Add filter logic to DataService.js
- Show filtered results immediately or on "Apply" click
- Add visual feedback (loading spinner, row count update)

---

### 3. PRE-BUILT REPORTS LIBRARY (Major Gap)

**What We Have:**
- Zero pre-built reports
- Data shown directly on dashboard pages

**What Competitors Have:**
- **Aircall:** 18 pre-built reports
- **Talkdesk:** 20+ pre-built reports
- **NICE:** 6 pre-built analytics applications
- All reports are customizable by customers

**Reports Competitors Provide:**
- Agent Performance Reports (6-8 reports)
- Team/Supervisor Reports (5-7 reports)
- Admin/Company Reports (4-6 reports)

**Impact:** HIGH - Pre-built reports are a key differentiator and accelerate customer time-to-value.

**Recommendation:**
- Create 15-18 report templates (matching Aircall)
- Use Salesforce native Report Builder
- Organize by role: Agent (6), Supervisor (6), Admin (6)
- Document in prototype as "Available Reports" section

---

### 4. REAL-TIME UPDATES (Major Gap)

**What We Have:**
- Static data loaded once
- Manual page refresh required for updates

**What Competitors Have:**
- **Talkdesk:** Intraday metrics updating virtually in real-time
- **Five9:** Real-time agent state monitoring, live queue status
- **8x8:** Real-time queue status and agent presence
- Auto-refresh intervals (30 sec, 1 min, 5 min)

**Features:**
- Live call volume counters
- Agent status changes (Available → On Call → Wrap-up)
- Queue depth updates
- Missed call alerts

**Impact:** MEDIUM-HIGH - Real-time is critical for supervisors monitoring operations

**Recommendation:**
- **Phase 1 (Prototype):** Add auto-refresh simulation (update metrics every 30 sec)
- **Phase 2 (Production):** Implement WebSocket/polling for real data
- Show "Last Updated" timestamp
- Add manual refresh button

---

### 5. ADVANCED METRICS (Major Gap)

**What We Have:**

- Best times to call
- Call waiting time (avg, longest)
- Call by country
- Call volume by account

**Five9:**

- Calls abandoned
- Average handle time (AHT)
- First call resolution (FCR)

**NICE:**
- Agent occupancy efficiency
- Lead conversion analysis
- Omnichannel effectiveness
- Digital contact handling

**8x8:**
- Sentiment analysis
- Team communication effectiveness

**Impact:** MEDIUM - Advanced metrics provide deeper insights but basic metrics cover core needs

**Recommendation:**
- **Phase 1:** Add 5-7 intermediate metrics:
  - Pick-up rate (% of calls answered)
  - Average wait time
  - Call outcomes breakdown (pie chart)
  - Calls by disposition
  - Peak calling hours
- **Phase 2:** Add advanced metrics based on customer feedback

---

**What We Have:**
- Fixed dashboard layouts
- No customization options

**What Competitors Have:**

**Talkdesk:**
- Drag & drop widgets
- Resizable components

## Conclusion

Our prototype demonstrates the **core concept** of a role-based Salesforce launchpad effectively. The **role-switching UX** and **basic dashboard structure** are solid.

However, to be competitive, we need:
- **Functional charts** (not placeholders)
- **Working filters and search**
- **Pre-built report library** (15-20 reports)
- **More advanced metrics**

The good news: Our **unique features** (announcements, onboarding, supervisor role) can be **key differentiators** if executed well.

**Bottom Line:** We've built a solid foundation. Now we need to add the features that competitors provide as standard while emphasizing our unique value propositions.
